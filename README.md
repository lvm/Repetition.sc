# Repetition.sc

*Heavily* inspired by TidalCycles. Consider this a (tiny) dialect that implements some of its features.

So far, i've implemented only these possibilities:

* Polyrhythms: "`a | b`"
* Groups: "`a+b`"
* Accents: "`a@`"
* Repetition: "`a!`"
* Multiplication: "`a*N`" (`N` -> `Int`)

All of this is "chainable".

## Examples

A fairly complex pattern (polyrhythms)

        "bd*3 | hq@+sn rm@! cp@".parseRepetitionPattern;

Is converted to
        
        -> [
            ( 'pattern': [ bd, bd, bd ],
              'accent': [ 0, 0, 0 ],
              'time': [ 0.33333333333333, 0.33333333333333, 0.33333333333333 ]
            ),
            ( 'pattern': [ hq, sn, rm, rm, cp ],
              'accent': [ 0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25 ],
              'time': [ 0.125, 0.125, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25 ]
            )
           ]

A polymeter
        
        x = "5@ x*4 | 4@ x*3".parseRepetitionPattern
        -> [
            ( 'pattern': [ 5, x, x, x, x ],
              'accent': [ 0.25, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
              'time': [ 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 ]
            ),
            ( 'pattern': [ 4, x, x, x ],
              'accent': [ 0.25, 0, 0, 0 ],
              'time': [ 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25 ]
            )
           ]

To "see" what's going on, it's possible to

        x[0].pattern.dup(4).flat;
        x[1].pattern.dup(5).flat;
        -> [ 5, x, x, x, x, 5, x, x, x, x, 5, x, x, x, x, 5, x, x, x, x ]
        -> [ 4, x, x, x, 4, x, x, x, 4, x, x, x, 4, x, x, x, 4, x, x, x ]


A simple Pbind
        
        (
        var notes = "0 0+3 7".parseRepetitionPattern;
        ~x = notes.at(0).asPbind((tempo: 60/60, type: \md, chan: 2, amp: 0.75));
        )

That is equivalent to
        
        (
        var notes = "0 0+3 7".parseRepetitionPattern.pop;
        ~x = Pbind(
          \tempo, 60/60,
          \type, \md,
          \amp, Pseq(notes.amp, inf) + 0.75,
          \dur, Pseq(notes.time, inf),
          \midinote, Pseq(notes.pattern.collect(_.asInt), inf) + 60,
          \sustain, Pkey(\dur),
          \chan, 2,
        );
        )

Another a bit more complex Pbind example
        
        (
        var pbd = (tempo: 60/60, type: \md, amp: 0.5);
        var drum = pbd.blend((chan: 9, cb: \asPerc));
        var test = "bd sn | ch*3 | 0@ 4 7 0 9 0".parseRepetitionPattern;
        ~q = test.at(0).asPbind(drum.blend((stut: 2)));
        ~w = test.at(1).asPbind(drum.blend((stretch: Pseq([1,1/4,1/2,2].stutter(4),inf))));
        ~e = test.at(2).asPbind(pbd.blend((chan: 4, octave: Pseq([3,4,5],inf), cb: \asInt, amp: 0.7)));
        )

In which I defined a dict, `pbd`, which later is blended with `drum` another dict which defines a midi channel. Later on, `drum` is blended once again with different settings, once using `stut` that internally is translated to a `Pstutter` and the other uses `stretch` that modifies the value of `dur` (0.3, 0.075, 0.15, 0.6) repeated 4 times each.  
Also, a _bass_ midi-synth is defined with `octave` which cycles twice in the same pattern:  0/3, 4/4, 7/5, 0/3, 9/4, 0/5.  
Finally, each dict has `cb`, which is basically a _callback_ over the current note being played.  

Another example using `ChordProg`. Patterns can be built from arrays aswell.

        (
        var chord = (
          \c: \min,
          \gs: \maj,
          \a: \min,
        );
        var p = [\c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \a, \gs, \a, \gs, \a, \gs, \a, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \gs, \c, \a, \gs, \a, \gs, \a, \gs, \a, \gs, \a, \gs, \a, \gs, \a, \gs, \a, \gs, \a].collect{
          |n|
          ChordProg.getChord(n, chord[n])
        }.flat.join(" ");
        var pbd = (tempo: 60/60, cb: \asInt, chan: 4, stretch: 26, type: \md, amp: 0.8);
        var polc = p.parseRepetitionPattern;
        ~poly = polc.at(0).asPbind(pbd);
        )


## Other features

### Callbacks

It affects the current event (from pattern) and applies a certain function:

* \asInt, converts to integer
* \asPerc, converts to midi note. See PercSymbol for more info
* \asChord, which takes an additional argument \chord
* \asSynth, which should be used with `\type, \dirt`, otherwise the value will be passed as `\note`8
* \asFn, which takes an additiona arg \fn (which should be a function)
 

For example
        
        (
        var pbd = (tempo: 60/60, octave: 5, type: \md, amp: 0.5);
        var ccc = "c d e".parseRepetitionPattern;
        ~ccc = ccc.at(0).asPbind(pbd.blend((chan: 4, cb: \asChord, chord: Pseq([\min,\maj,\maj7],inf))));
        )

Which will be rendered as: `Cmin, DMaj, EMaj7`  
Or  

        (
        var pbd = (tempo: 60/60, octave: 0, type: \md, amp: 0.5);
        var fun = "bd".parseRepetitionPattern;
        ~fun = fun.at(0).asPbind(pbd.blend((chan: 9, cb: \asFn, fn: {|x| [x].asGMPerc + (12..24).choose })));
        )

In this particular case, the function will add a number between 12 and 24 to the current midinote". Also notice `octave: 0`. That is because, again, in this particular case, it's a Event type MIDI and it'll add automatically `octave: 5`, so 36 (bd) instead of ending between 48 and 60, would end between 108 and 120 (`octave: 5` equals to `current-note + 12*Pkey(\octave)`).


### Bjorklund / Euclidean Rhythm:

Repetition isn't flexible as Tidal itself but taking advantage of the `Bjorklund` Quark, we are able to generate Strings that represent the same rhythm. The valid args are `k` which represents the amount of notes distributed in `n` places, and `rotate` which will shift positions.  
For example:
        
        "bd".asBjorklund(4, 16).quote;
        -> "bd r r r bd r r r bd r r r bd r r r"

        "bd".asBjorklund(4, 16, 2).quote;
        -> "r r bd r r r bd r r r bd r r r bd r"

Additionally, it's possible to pass more than one 'symbol' as a Bjorklund pattern, such as "sn rm", which is converted to a group, "sn+rm", therefore creating a _longer_ pattern but maintaining the same duration.  
For example:
        
        "bd sn".asBjorklund(1,4).parseRepetitionPattern
        -> "bd+sn r r r"
        -> [
            ( 'pattern': [ bd, sn, r, r, r ],
              'time': [ 0.125, 0.125, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25 ],
              'accent': [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
            )
           ]

So, instead of dividing each value by the total amount (1/5), it's divided by 1/4 and the group by the amount of items in it (1/2). This can be seen clearly in the 'time' Array.
  
An example chaining Bjorklund/Euclidean rhythms:

        (
        var pbd = (tempo: 60/60, type: \md, amp: 0.75, chan: 9, cb: \asPerc);
        var pat = ("bd".asBjorklund(3,8))+"| r r r sn r r | r ch ch@ ch |"+("rm".asBjorklund(5,8))+"|cp";
        var t8 = pat.parseRepetitionPattern;
        ~t80 = t8.at(0).asPbind(pbd);
        ~t81 = t8.at(1).asPbind(pbd);
        ~t82 = t8.at(2).asPbind(pbd);
        ~t83 = t8.at(3).asPbind(pbd);
        ~t84 = t8.at(4).asPbind(pbd);
        )
